## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/company/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/company/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete Alice Pauline`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI Component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/company/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/company/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic Component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/company/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete Alice Pauline")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete Alice Pauline` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a contact).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model Component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/company/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the company book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores a `CommandHistory` object that keeps track of the commands a user inputs during runtime. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyCommandHistory` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage Component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/company/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both company book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.company.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


#### Sort Feature

Sorting is facilitated by `SortCommand` and `SortCommandParser`, following these steps:

1. **User input parsing**: `SortCommandParser#parse()` tokenizes the user input into an `ArgumentMultimap` containing the field and order values, then validates the tokens and creates a `SortCommand` object with the parsed parameters.

2. **Comparator Creation**: `SortCommand#execute()` calls `SortCommand#getComparator()` which creates the appropriate `Comparator<Person>` based on the specified field (name/tag) and order (ascending/descending).

3. **Model update**: `SortCommand` invokes `Model#sortPersons(comparator)` to trigger the sorting operation.

4. **Sorting execution**: The sort operation cascades through:
    * `Model#sortPersons(comparator)` &rarr; `AddressBook#sortPersons(comparator)` &rarr; `UniquePersonList#sortPersons(comparator)`

5. **Result**: A `CommandResult` is returned to display the success message to the user.

The sequence diagram below shows how the sort operation works:
![Sort Sequence Diagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

The activity diagram below depicts the execution flow of the sort command:
![Sort Activity Diagram](images/SortActivityDiagram.png)


#### Filter Feature
The filtering mechanism is facilitated by `FilterCommand` and `FilterCommandParser`, following these steps:

1. **User input parsing**: `FilterCommandParser#parse()` tokenizes the user input into an `ArgumentMultimap` containing tag values, then validates the tokens through `FilterCommandParser#checkValidTokens()`. The parser converts all tags to lowercase, removes duplicates, and creates a `TagsContainTagPredicate` object with the processed tags. A `FilterCommand` object is then instantiated with this predicate.

2. **Validation checks**: The parser performs several validations:
    * Ensures that at least one `PREFIX_TAG` token exists
    * Verifies no input exists between "filter" and the first prefix
    * Confirms no empty tags are present
    * Validates all tag names are alphanumeric

3. **Model update**: `FilterCommand#execute()` invokes `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)` to apply the filtering operation.

4. **Filtering execution**: The model updates its filtered person list by applying the `TagsContainTagPredicate`, which matches any person whose tags contain at least one of the specified tags (case-insensitive matching).

5. **Result**: A `CommandResult` is returned displaying the number of persons found matching the filter criteria.

The sequence diagram below shows how the filter operation works:
![Filter Sequence Diagram](images/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)

The activity diagram below depicts the execution flow of the filter command:
![Filter Activity Diagram](images/FilterActivityDiagram.png)

#### Repeat Command Feature
The repeat mechanism is facilitated by `CommandHistory` Model and `LogicManager`.

The Sequence diagram for a NextCommand Operation

1. **Key Pressed**: `CommandBox` handles the event with a call to `navigateCommandHistory(x)` with `x` being '-1' for previous command, and `1' for next command in history.

2. **Command Bubbles Down**: A series of function calls are then passed through the Logic Component and the Model Component

3. **Get Last Nth Command**: `CommandHistory` gets the last nth command based on its current context of `currCommandIndex` and returns the respective string value of the command saved in history.

4. **Update CommandBox**: Target Command String gets returned back and `CommandBox` updates its text field to show the command, along with setting the cursor to end of line.

<puml src="diagrams/CommandHistoryDiagram.puml" width="100%" />


[To include implementations once finalised - with PUML]
### Add Contact with Basic Information
The add operation is facilitated by the `AddCommandBasic` class within the Logic and Model components.

The Sequence diagram for an **Add Basic Command** operation is shown below.

1. **User Input**: The user enters the command `addbasic n/NAME p/PHONE` in the `CommandBox` (e.g., `addbasic n/Jadon p/88880000`).

2. **Command Parsing and Execution**:  
   The input is passed from the `CommandBox` to the `MainWindow`, which then invokes the `LogicManager` to execute the command.  
   `LogicManager` constructs an `AddCommandBasic` object with a `Person` instance containing the specified name and phone number.

3. **Model Update**:  
   The `AddCommandBasic` checks through the `ModelManager` to verify if the person already exists.  
   If not found, the new person is added to the model and stored in memory.

4. **Success Message**:  
   Upon successful addition, `Messages.format()` is called to format the result, and a `CommandResult` is returned to `LogicManager`.  
   The `MainWindow` then updates the UI to display the success message in the `CommandBox`.
